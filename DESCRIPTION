Description:
    jTransform carries out common data management tasks and transformations of
    data sets. It includes functions to search and replace values, to sort a
    data set after one or more variable, to change the order of variables in a
    data set, to transform data sets from long to wide or from wide to long,
    to transpose data sets (make rows into columns and columns into rows), and
    to add columns from one or more additional data sets to the currently
    opened data set.
    jTransform calls functions from the R-package `jmvReadWrite`,
    (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=jmvReadWrite>) enabling access to
    these functions via a graphical user interface (without the need to use
    a R command line for these transformations).
