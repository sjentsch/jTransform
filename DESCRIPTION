Description:
    The jamovi module jTransform carries out common data management tasks and
    transformations of data sets. It includes functions to change the order of
    / re-arrange variables in a data set, transforming a data set from long to
    wide or from wide to long, transposing a data set (make rows into columns
    and columns into rows), sorting a data set after one or more variable, and
    adding columns from one or more additional data sets to the currently
    opened data set. In addition, there are functions to search or replace
    values. Furthermore, there is a function to apply transformations for
    skewed variables trying to make them better conform to a normal
    distribution. Finally, there is a function to calculate distances /
    proximities. jTransform calls functions from the R-package `jmvReadWrite`,
    (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=jmvReadWrite>) enabling access to
    these functions via a graphical user interface (without the need to use
    a R command line for these transformations).
