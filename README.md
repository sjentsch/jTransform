The jamovi module jTransform carries out common data management tasks and
transformations of data sets. It is supposed to be a Swiss-Army-knife for such
tasks.
The module includes functions to search or replace values. In addition, it
contains functions to change the order of / re-arrange variables in a data set,
transforming a data set from long to wide or from wide to long, transposing a
data set (make rows into columns and columns into rows), sorting a data set
after one or more variable, and adding columns from one or more additional data
sets to the currently opened data set.
Finally, there are functions to carry out calculations, including a function to
aggregate data, to apply transformations for skewed variables trying to make
them better conform to a normal distribution, and for calculating distance
measures.

## Install in jamovi

If you haven't already installed [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html),
install it. Open jamovi, and select the jamovi modules library and
[install](https://jamovi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/howto_Install_modules.html)
jTransform from there.

## Install the development version (from source)

Assuming that you have [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/download.html) and 
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) already installed on your machine, open
`R` and install the R-package `jmvtools` using the following command (this
is only required once before the first use):

```
install.packages('jmvtools', repos='https://repo.jamovi.org')
```


Clone this repository (or [download the ZIP file](../../archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
and extract it). In `R`, go to the directory where you cloned or extracted the
repository to, and compile the module with:

```
jmvtools::install()
```

The module then appears among your jamovi modules.
