When assigning them, you first need to \"Create a new long variable\" and to name the first one (default \"long_y\") \"rspCrr\", and the second one \"rspTme\". Afterwards, you assign all variables starting with \"rspCrr_\" to the variable list of the first variable, and all variables starting with \"rspTme_\" to the variable list of the second variable. Then, you need to define the index variables. Check in which order your variables are arranged: The index variable that changes from one variable name to the next comes first, and for each of the higher index variables all steps of lower index variables have to have been through a complete round, before going up a step on this variable. In the example data set, rspCrr_cong_GREEN_1 is followed by rspCrr_incong_GREEN_1 and rspCrr_neutral_GREEN_1 (don't focus on the rspTme_... variables in between). Therefore, cond is the first index variable with three steps (cong, incong, neutral), and you should change \"index1\" to \"cond\" and \"0\" to \"3\". The next level is the colour (rspCrr_neutral_GREEN_1 is followed by rspCrr_cong_YELLOW_1), and you should set the name of the index variable to \"colour\" and \"N levels\" to \"4\" (as there are four colours: GREEN, YELLOW, RED, and BLUE). The highest level is repetition (rspCrr_neutral_BLUE_1 is followed by rspCrr_cong_GREEN_2), and you should thus set the name of the index variable to \"rep\" and the \"N levels\" to two (1 and 2). Once you did all this, and the number of variables in the variable lists for the long variables under \"Variables To Be Transformed\" - 24 - matches up with the product of \"N levels\" - 3 (cond) * 4 (colour) * 2 = 24 - a \"Data Preview\" and an overview over the \"Repeated-Measures Levels\" is shown, and you can open the transformed data set (after checking those tables) in a new jamovi window by pressing the \"Create\"-button.</p>\n"))}))
