  The jamovi module jTransform carries out common data management tasks and
  transformations of data sets. It includes functions to change the order of /
  re-arrange variables in a data set, transforming a data set from long to wide
  or from wide to long, transposing a data set (make rows into columns and
  columns into rows), sorting a data set after one or more variable, and adding
  columns from one or more additional data sets to the currently opened data
  set. In addition, there are functions to search or replace values.
  Furthermore, there is a function to apply transformations for skewed variables
  trying to make them better conform to a normal distribution. Finally, there is
  a function to calculate distances / proximities. jTransform calls functions
  from the R-package `jmvReadWrite`,
  (<https://cran.r-project.org/package=jmvReadWrite>) enabling access to these
  functions via a graphical user interface (without the need to use a R command
  line for these transformations).
